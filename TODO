Descide if it is nessisary to finish implementing having multiple catagoies of
  subscribers in SnakeEngineInterfaceController and everywhere else.
Fully implement the user interface with buttons etc.
Figure how messages are sent and receved without building a circular call stack
  (maybe create an action stack of actions)
Add Error handling to the interface between WindowHandler and the raw ncurses
  library
